        <p class="hero-main-text">Mental Health</p>
        <p class="hero-sec-text">Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act, and helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices.
             It's a crucial aspect of overall health and quality of life, impacting how people cope with stress, build relationships, and make decisions. Mental health is not just the absence of mental illness; it's a spectrum of experiences that can vary from person to person.

                Slow down. Don’t allow others to hurry your healing. It is a process, one that may take years, occasionally, even a lifetime – and that’s OK." </p>
